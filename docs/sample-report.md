## Tips for Best Results

   - Ensure good lighting and contrast
   - Avoid shadows or glare

2. **Text Clarity:**
   - Use clear, readable fonts
   - Avoid handwritten text if possible
   - Ensure text is horizontal (not rotated)

3. **Format:**
   - Keep partner names and hours on the same line
   - Use consistent spacing
   - Avoid special characters in names

4. **What to Avoid:**
   - Blurry or low-quality images
   - Skewed or rotated text
   - Overlapping text or graphics
   - Very small font sizes

## Manual Entry Alternative

If OCR doesn't work well with your report format, you can:
1. Take note of the extracted text
2. Manually create a simple text file with the format above
3. Take a screenshot of that text
4. Upload the screenshot

This ensures the OCR can accurately read the information.
